#Problem 1
You’re locked in a room with no food. After two days, you’re given four bottles of milk, one of which is deadly poison. 
To figure out which bottle is poisonous, you can give samples to a rat in the room. However, the poison takes ten hours to kill. 
You only have 24 hours to drink three bottles of milk to survive. 
How can you safely drink three bottles of milk and identify the poisonous one within this time limit?

#Problem 2
Imagine this: four people are stranded on one side of a rickety old bridge at night. To make matters worse, they only have one flashlight! 
The bridge is narrow, so only two people can cross at a time. And here's the kicker: each person takes a different amount of time to cross – 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes, respectively.

How can they all get across the bridge in the shortest amount of time? This classic puzzle challenges you to think critically and optimize your solution. 
It's a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their problem-solving skills, especially in the context of software engineering, where efficiency is key.

Spoiler Alert: The Solution

To minimize the total time, the strategy is to pair the slowest people together whenever possible. Here's how:

Send the two fastest across: The 1-minute and 2-minute people cross together (2 minutes).
Send one fast person back: The 1-minute person returns with the flashlight (1 minute).
Send the two slowest across: The 7-minute and 10-minute people cross together (10 minutes).
Send the fastest person back: The 1-minute person returns with the flashlight (1 minute).
Send the two fastest across: The 1-minute and 2-minute people cross together (2 minutes).
By following this plan, all four people can safely cross the bridge in a total of 17 minutes.


#Problem 3
Heaven or Hell Puzzle

You're faced with a life-or-death choice: two doors, one leading to heaven and the other to hell. Standing guard by each door are two individuals, one always truthful, the other always deceitful. 
You can only ask one question to one guard. What do you ask to ensure you choose the door to heaven?

The solution: Ask either guard, "If I asked the other guard which door leads to heaven, what would they say?" Then, choose the opposite door.

If you ask the truth-teller: They'll honestly tell you the liar would point to the wrong door.
If you ask the liar: They'll lie about what the truth-teller would say, also leading you to the wrong door.
By asking this specific question, you can effectively bypass the deception and choose the correct door.


#Problem 4
Three Mislabeled Jars

You're presented with three mislabeled jars. One jar holds only apples, another only oranges, and the last a mix of both. Your task: correctly label each jar with the fewest number of fruit picks.

The Solution:

Pick one fruit: Select a single piece of fruit from the jar labeled "mixed."
Label accordingly:
If an apple: The "mixed" jar is actually "apples only," meaning the "apples" jar is the mixed one, and the "oranges" jar remains oranges.
If an orange: The "mixed" jar is "oranges only," making the "oranges" jar the mixed one, and the "apples" jar remains apples.
By picking just one fruit, you can accurately label all three jars.


#Problem 5
Man Fell in Well Puzzle

A man tumbled into a well. The well's depth is thirty meters. He is capable of climbing 4 meters in a day, yet he slips 3 meters. In what number of days would he emerge from the well?


The solution:

On the first day, the man gains one meter overall after climbing four meters and slipping back three meters. 
Thus, it continues until the 27th day, when he clambers from 27 to 31 meters above the ground and permanently exits the well without falling back in.

#Problem 6
Bag of Coins Puzzle
You have ten bags of coins, but one bag contains counterfeit coins that are slightly heavier. How can you identify the counterfeit bag with the fewest weighings?

Solution:

Number the bags: Label each bag from 1 to 10.
Take coins: From bag 1, take 1 coin; from bag 2, take 2 coins; and so on, up to 10 coins from bag 10.
Weigh the coins: Place all the selected coins on a scale.
Identify the counterfeit:
If the weight is a whole number: All coins are genuine.
If the weight is a decimal: The decimal part indicates the bag number of the counterfeit coins. For example, if the weight is 5.2 grams, bag 2 (with 2 coins) is the counterfeit one.
By following this approach, you can pinpoint the counterfeit bag with a single weighing.


#Problem 7
Horses on a Race Track Puzzle

Imagine you have 25 horses and 5 race tracks. Your goal is to find the top 3 fastest horses in the fewest number of races. 
This is like figuring out the most efficient way to complete tasks in software development.

Solution:

Divide and Race: Split the horses into 5 groups of 5 and race each group.
The Fastest Five: Take the winner from each group and race them together. The winner of this race is the fastest horse.
Finding the Next Two: Race the horses that came second and third in the winning group's race, along with the next two fastest horses you've identified.
By following these steps, you can find the top 3 horses in just 7 races.



#Problem 8 
Imagine 100 doors, all initially closed. 100 monkeys, one by one, are released to manipulate these doors. 
The first monkey opens every door. The second closes every second door. The third toggles every third door (opening closed ones and closing open ones), and so on.

After all monkeys have completed their tasks, which doors remain open?

Solution:
Let's consider a specific door, say door number 56. It will be affected by monkeys corresponding to its divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56). 
Each pair of divisors (like 1 and 56, 2 and 28, etc.) will result in the door's state being toggled twice, effectively canceling each other out. 
However, for perfect squares (like 16, which has divisors 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 16), there's an odd number of divisors, leaving the door open in the end.

Therefore, only doors that are perfect squares will remain open after all the monkeys have finished their work.


#Problem 9
A blind man is alone on a deserted island. He has two blue pills and two red pills. He must take exactly one red pill and one blue pill or he will die.


Solution:
Firstly, break each of the pills in half, and as you do this pop one half in your mouth and lay the other half aside for tomorrow. 
When he’s done this with all four pills he will have consumed one red pill and one blue pill. And have the same leftover.


#Problem 10
There were 200 fishes in an aquarium, 99% of which were red.
How many red fishes must be removed to make the percentage of red fishes 98%?

Solution:
Remove 100 fishes
Total Fishes = 200
Red fishes = 99% == 198
Remove 100 red fishes
so remaining total fishes = 100 and out of them 98 are RED.
total: 100, red: 98, percent:98%

#Problem 11
Faulty Robot

A company manufactures robots. Few robots are programmed to tell the truth no matter what, whereas others are programmed to lie. 
So there are two communities in the factory, i.e. the Truth Community and the Lie Community.
You meet with three robots and ask one of them which community do you belong to? 
Robot 1 replies to something in binary that you don’t understand. The Second robot says that Robot 1 belongs to Lie Community. 
The Third Robot says that the Second Robot is lying. Which community does the Third Robot belong to?

Solution: 
Let’s assume Robot 1 belongs to the Truth Community. If so, he will not lie and tell he’s from the truth community. In this case, Robot 2 is Lying, and Robot 3 is right about it. If Robot 1 belongs to the Lie Community, he will lie from Truth Community, which means Robot 2 is again lying, which makes Robot 3 again being right about it. 
Therefore Robot 3 is from the “TRUTH COMMUNITY”.


#Problem 12
Black and White Hats

One hundred students stand in line, one in front of the other, each wearing a black hat or a white hat. 
Every student can see the hats of their classmate in front but not their hats or those worn by anyone behind. 
The class teacher starts at the back of the line and asks each student the colour of their hat. If they answer correctly, they will pass the final exam. 
If they get it wrong, they’ll fail. How many students will pass at most if they are allowed to discuss a strategy before their teacher starts asking the colours of their hats?

Solution: 
Ninety-nine students can pass the final exam by using a simple strategy. The students decide that the last standing student will count and shout the colour in odd numbers in front. 
Going ahead, the other students can use simple maths to predict their hat colour. The 100th student also has a 50-50 chance.

Ex: The 100th student sees the number of white hats in front is odd, so he says white. The 99th kid now counts the number of white hats in front. 
If it is odd, then he has a white hat. Else he has the black hat, and similarly, other students can predict their cap colour.



#Problem 13
Money Heist

You are at the Bank of Portugal. It has excellent security measures. There are 2 Locker Rooms. 
One contains 1000 tons of Gold, whereas the other is an unescapable Police Trap. You being the Professor, have found a loophole. 
The two guards securing the Gates are innocent and have a weird family tradition. One Guard never lies, and the other never speaks the truth. 
You are disguised as an older man and can ask them no more than a question before becoming suspicious. 
So what question do you ask any one of them and know the right room that contains the treasure and inform the gang can carry out the heist successfully?

Solution: 

Ask any guard, “What would the other guard say if I ask which way is to the Police Trap ?”
And whatever answer he gives is the way to Treasure.

Explanation:
If you end up asking the truthful one, he will speak the truth, and he knows that another guard will lie so that he will show the way to the treasure.
 
If you end up asking the question to the liar, he will lie about the other, and the answer will be the way to the treasure.


#Problem 14
The Chocolate Lover
 
You have ten white chocolates and ten dark chocolates with no distinction in packaging. 
What is the minimum number of draws at random, so one has two chocolates of the same type?

 
Solution: 
The minimum no of steps are three.
1. Let say you draw a dark chocolate
2. Let say you draw a white chocolate
3. Either it will be black or white, we’ll have one pair complete.
4. Even if we pick all three chocolates of the same colour, we will still have a pair, so three random picks are sufficient
