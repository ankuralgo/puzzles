#Problem 1
You’re locked in a room with no food. After two days, you’re given four bottles of milk, one of which is deadly poison. 
To figure out which bottle is poisonous, you can give samples to a rat in the room. However, the poison takes ten hours to kill. 
You only have 24 hours to drink three bottles of milk to survive. 
How can you safely drink three bottles of milk and identify the poisonous one within this time limit?

#Problem 2
Imagine this: four people are stranded on one side of a rickety old bridge at night. To make matters worse, they only have one flashlight! 
The bridge is narrow, so only two people can cross at a time. And here's the kicker: each person takes a different amount of time to cross – 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes, respectively.

How can they all get across the bridge in the shortest amount of time? This classic puzzle challenges you to think critically and optimize your solution. 
It's a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their problem-solving skills, especially in the context of software engineering, where efficiency is key.

Spoiler Alert: The Solution

To minimize the total time, the strategy is to pair the slowest people together whenever possible. Here's how:

Send the two fastest across: The 1-minute and 2-minute people cross together (2 minutes).
Send one fast person back: The 1-minute person returns with the flashlight (1 minute).
Send the two slowest across: The 7-minute and 10-minute people cross together (10 minutes).
Send the fastest person back: The 1-minute person returns with the flashlight (1 minute).
Send the two fastest across: The 1-minute and 2-minute people cross together (2 minutes).
By following this plan, all four people can safely cross the bridge in a total of 17 minutes.


#Problem 3
Heaven or Hell Puzzle

You're faced with a life-or-death choice: two doors, one leading to heaven and the other to hell. Standing guard by each door are two individuals, one always truthful, the other always deceitful. 
You can only ask one question to one guard. What do you ask to ensure you choose the door to heaven?

The solution: Ask either guard, "If I asked the other guard which door leads to heaven, what would they say?" Then, choose the opposite door.

If you ask the truth-teller: They'll honestly tell you the liar would point to the wrong door.
If you ask the liar: They'll lie about what the truth-teller would say, also leading you to the wrong door.
By asking this specific question, you can effectively bypass the deception and choose the correct door.


#Problem 4
Three Mislabeled Jars

You're presented with three mislabeled jars. One jar holds only apples, another only oranges, and the last a mix of both. Your task: correctly label each jar with the fewest number of fruit picks.

The Solution:

Pick one fruit: Select a single piece of fruit from the jar labeled "mixed."
Label accordingly:
If an apple: The "mixed" jar is actually "apples only," meaning the "apples" jar is the mixed one, and the "oranges" jar remains oranges.
If an orange: The "mixed" jar is "oranges only," making the "oranges" jar the mixed one, and the "apples" jar remains apples.
By picking just one fruit, you can accurately label all three jars.


#Problem 5
Man Fell in Well Puzzle

A man tumbled into a well. The well's depth is thirty meters. He is capable of climbing 4 meters in a day, yet he slips 3 meters. In what number of days would he emerge from the well?


The solution:

On the first day, the man gains one meter overall after climbing four meters and slipping back three meters. 
Thus, it continues until the 27th day, when he clambers from 27 to 31 meters above the ground and permanently exits the well without falling back in.

#Problem 6
Bag of Coins Puzzle
You have ten bags of coins, but one bag contains counterfeit coins that are slightly heavier. How can you identify the counterfeit bag with the fewest weighings?

Solution:

Number the bags: Label each bag from 1 to 10.
Take coins: From bag 1, take 1 coin; from bag 2, take 2 coins; and so on, up to 10 coins from bag 10.
Weigh the coins: Place all the selected coins on a scale.
Identify the counterfeit:
If the weight is a whole number: All coins are genuine.
If the weight is a decimal: The decimal part indicates the bag number of the counterfeit coins. For example, if the weight is 5.2 grams, bag 2 (with 2 coins) is the counterfeit one.
By following this approach, you can pinpoint the counterfeit bag with a single weighing.


#Problem 7
Horses on a Race Track Puzzle

Imagine you have 25 horses and 5 race tracks. Your goal is to find the top 3 fastest horses in the fewest number of races. 
This is like figuring out the most efficient way to complete tasks in software development.

Solution:

Divide and Race: Split the horses into 5 groups of 5 and race each group.
The Fastest Five: Take the winner from each group and race them together. The winner of this race is the fastest horse.
Finding the Next Two: Race the horses that came second and third in the winning group's race, along with the next two fastest horses you've identified.
By following these steps, you can find the top 3 horses in just 7 races.
